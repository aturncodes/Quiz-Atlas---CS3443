Group Project completed by myself and a few peers for Application Programming at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

The application was completed over the course of 3 months. The goal was to create a simple, interactive educational program based on geography and linguistics. The team worked to compile data and create interactive
quizzes using Java in Android Studio. Image assets were created and designed by the team using Adobe Photoshop.
